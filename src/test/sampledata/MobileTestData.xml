                                README for TestData specification

        Section:
                        A set of test data which includes the actionName for which
                        the provided list of tags needs to be verified.

        actionName:
                        A (String) name representing the action done in the UI,
                        for which we want to do Web Analytics Testing.

        numberOfEventsTriggered:
                        The number of events that "should" be triggered for the
                        actionName specified.
                        The (numerical) value provided for this attribute indicates
                        the number of requests sent to the Web Analytic system for
                        the action.

        tagList:
                        A delimited set of tags that you want to verify from any of
                        the requests sent to analytics tool on the action performed.
                        The tags specified are order independent, and case-SENSITIVE.

                        NOTE: If you are using OmnitureDebugger, the tags are seen
                        differently based on the UI Testing Framework being used.
                        This is because of the difference in the way JavaScript is
                        executed and results being interpreted by the individual
                        UI framework.

                        See the examples below for:
                         > actionName: OpenUpcomingPage_OmnitureDebugger_Selenium
                         > actionName: OpenUpcomingPage_OmnitureDebugger_WebDriver

        delimiter:
                        A separator used to distinguish between tags.
                        || is the delimiter used in WAAT.
